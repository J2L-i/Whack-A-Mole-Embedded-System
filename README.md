# CMake SFML Project Template

This repository template should allow for a fast and hassle-free kick start of your next SFML project using CMake.
Thanks to [GitHub's nature of templates](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), you can fork this repository without inheriting its Git history.

The template starts out very basic, but might receive additional features over time:

- Basic CMake script to build your project and link SFML on any operating system
- Basic [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) script for all major platforms

## How to Use

1. Follow the above instructions about how to use GitHub's project template feature to create your own project.
1. Open [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt). Rename the project and the executable to whatever name you want. The project and executable names don't have to match.
1. If you want to add or remove any .cpp files, change the source files listed in the [`add_executable`](CMakeLists.txt#L10) call in CMakeLists.txt to match the source files your project requires. If you plan on keeping the default main.cpp file then no changes are required.
1. If you use Linux, install SFML's dependencies using your system package manager. On Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions you can use the following commands:
    ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install \
        libxrandr-dev \
        libxcursor-dev \
        libudev-dev \
        libfreetype-dev \
        libopenal-dev \
        libflac-dev \
        libvorbis-dev \
        libgl1-mesa-dev \
        libegl1-mesa-dev
    ```
1. Configure and build your project. Most popular IDEs support CMake projects with very little effort on your part.
    - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) via the [CMake extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-linux)
    - [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-170)
    - [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/features/cmake-support.html)
    - [Qt Creator](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-cmake.html)

    Using CMake from the command line is straightforward as well.

    For a single-configuration generator (typically the case on Linux and macOS):
    ```
    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build
    ```

    For a multi-configuration generator (typically the case on Windows):
    ```
    cmake -S . -B build
    ```
    Add the .tff file, background and mole .png files to the build/bin folder
    Go to the build/bin folder and run the binary file
1. Enjoy!
